# App Market Analysis - Data Manipulation and Visualization Project
This is the first Data Manipulation and Visualization project realised as part of the course with **Start2Impact**, using Python.  

The aim of the project is to provide an in-depth analysis of Android app data in order to support decision-making in the creation of a new app. The data used comes from two main datasets:   
**Dataset App (df)**: contains information on Android apps, such as name, category, reviews, size, installations, type, price and more.    
**Dataset Recensioni (Gr)**: contains translated app reviews with information on the sentiment, polarity and subjectivity of the reviews.


# Data source
The data used in this project are taken from the Kaggle dataset on mobile apps

# Libraries used
Pandas: for the processing and manipulation of data.  
Matplotlib, Seaborn e Plotly: to create graphs and visualisations, improve the graphical appearance and make the interpretation of data clearer.
